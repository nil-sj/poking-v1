# Poking Kids
Deal with the poking kids in an engaging way.

Parenting is tough. It's tougher when you have a poking kid.

But here is what gives you some respite when your beloved kid is trying real hard to poke on your personal device.

Let your kiddo press a random key on your keyboard and disover a special Cocomelon character. You can press Cmd + Shift + Enter to get into or exit out of the fullscreen mode.
